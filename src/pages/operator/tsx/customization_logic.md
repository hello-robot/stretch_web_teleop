# **Overview of Customization Logic**

# Layout

The `layout` is passed into `Operator` as a property. The `layout` defines which components are in the layout and how they're arranged. Below is a very simple example:

```ts
import {
  LayoutDefinition,
  ComponentType,
  ActionModeType,
  CameraViewId,
  ButtonPadId,
  OverheadVideoStreamDef,
  TabDefinition,
  PanelDefinition,
} from "/utils/component_definitions";

export const SIMPLE_LAYOUT: LayoutDefinition = {
  // All components have a type
  type: ComponentType.Layout,
  // If voice control should be displayed on the operator page
  displayVoiceControl: false,
  // The state of the action mode dropdown
  actionMode: ActionModeType.StepActions,

  // The customizable components in the layout
  children: [
    {
      // The layout contains a single panel
      type: ComponentType.Panel,
      children: [
        {
          // The panel contains a single tab
          type: ComponentType.SingleTab,
          // The title of the tab is "Tab One"
          label: "Tab One",
          children: [
            {
              // Tab contains a single camera view
              type: ComponentType.CameraView,
              // From the Stretch overhead camera
              id: CameraViewId.overhead,
              children: [
                {
                  // Camera view has a button pad overlay
                  type: ComponentType.ButtonPad,
                  // Button pad to control the base
                  id: ButtonPadId.Drive,
                },
              ],
            } as OverheadVideoStreamDef,
          ],
        } as TabDefinition,
      ],
    } as PanelDefinition,
  ],
};
```

The layout is an object containing a set of nested `ComponentDefinitions`, where each `ComponentDefinition` represents the details for a `CustomizableComponent` to render.

For more layout examples, see the predefined default layouts can be found in `./tsx/default_layouts/`.

All of the definitions for the different component definitions can be found in `./tsx/utils/component_definitions.tsx`

# Logic for Adding, Rearranging, and Removing Components

## Selecting a Component

`CustomizableComponents` can be **selected** in the `LayoutArea` or from the `Sidebar`'s component provider. The screenshot above shows the Realsense Camera View selected from the `Sidebar`'s component provider.

`Operator` **keeps track of the selected component** using its `selectedPath` and `selectedDefinition` fields.

- the `selectedDefinition` is the `ComponentDefinition` for the selected object
- the `selectedPath` is a string representing the path to the component in the layout.
- when nothing is selected, these fields are `undefined`

> For example: the path to the right video stream would be `0-0-1`, because it's at the 1 index in the tab, which is at the 0 index in the panel, which is in the 0 index in the layout.

## DropZones

The `LayoutArea` is made up of two main elements: `CustomizableComponent` and `DropZone`.

`DropZone` shows the user where they can place elements. In the image above the **gray areas with dotted outlines** are each a `DropZone`, where the user can click to place the camera view.

During customization mode, a `DropZone` will only appear if the `canDrop()` function (defined in `DropZone.tsx`) evaluates to `true`.

When a user clicks on a `DropZone`, it executes a callback to `handleDrop()` (defined in `Operator.tsx`) with the path to the `DropZone` in the `LayoutArea`. This then modifies the `layout` structure stored in `Operator` to represent the change.

## Adding a Component

- When a component is selected from the `Sidebar`, `selectedDefinition` is set with the corresponding `type` (and `id` if applicable).
- `selectedPath` is undefined since components in the sidebar are not in the layout and thus do not have a `path`.
- When the user clicks on a `DropZone` the new `ComponentDefinition` is added to the `layout` in `Operator`

## Moving a Component

- When a component is selected from `LayoutArea`, the `CustomizableComponent` calls `handleSelect()` in `Operator` with its `path` and `definition`. This sets the `selectedPath` and `selectedDefinition` state in `Operator`.
- When the user clicks on a `DropZone` the component is removed from its old position in the `layout` and added to a new position at the `path` of the clicked `DropZone`.

## Removing a Component

- Once a component from the `LayoutArea` is selected, the delete button in the bottom of the sidebar will become enabled.
- When the user clicks on the delete button, it calls `handleDelete()` in `Operator` which removes the component from the layout.
